What we need to complete for the task:
Creating a menu with options to create a new game, difficulty. Make it aesthetically pleasing using minimalistic deisng.
Create the board in which shows the game being played (JFrame). Make sure that it is refreshing and uses the users preference as to the difficulty of the level of the game, ie easy, medium, hard.
Will need to create an AI that will play the game and ensure that it uses various decision making trees.
Making animations will be based on refreshing the JFrame with items moving in accordance to what we want to animate (ie the piece falling down the chute). Sound can be arranged. 
Ensure that when the game is closed, make sure to free the memory as this will cause problems when multiple instances are being run.
Key preference. The two players will play with the arrows and space to drop the piece. Need to animate the top section to ensure that everyone can see where they are dropping their piece.
Need to allocate all the jobs. UML diagrams need to be created.


Aditional notes:
1. Make sure there is enough time after finishing the game that we can bug test and make changes where necessary.
2. Ensure communication channels remain open to show that we are communicating as a group.
